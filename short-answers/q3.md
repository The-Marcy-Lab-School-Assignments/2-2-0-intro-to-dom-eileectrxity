# Question 3
What's the difference between `.innerText` and `.textContent`?

# Answer
For the following HTML code:

```html
<nav>
  <a>Home</a>
  <a>About</a>
  <a>Contact</a>
  <a style="display: none">Pricing</a>
</nav>
```

The differences between `.innerText` and `.textContent` are very subtle but important to distinguish between. Both of these properties can access and manipulate an element's text. However, they ultimately differ when it comes to CSS styling, where `.textContent` ignores it and `.innerText` respects it.

To elaborate, there are other differences that can be used to distinguish between the two, depending on whether one is performing a Read or a Write operation. Below, I will also add `.innerHTML` to the comparison as it functions similarly.

|           |                         |                                  |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| textContent | innerText               | innerHTML                        |

| ≈ Raw Text | ≈ Rendered Text | ≈ Raw HTML |
| **Read**: Retrieves all text content within an element as plain text, including child and text nodes, even if hidden. It does not consider CSS styling that affects visibility. | **Read**: Retrieves what's visibly rendered on the screen as plain text, excluding hidden elements while not interpreting HTML tags. Useful when you need just the text that users can see. | **Read**: Retrieves the entire HTML structure inside an element, including all child elements and their respective HTML markup. Useful for facilitating dynamic content updates and complex DOM manipulations. |
| **Write**: Sets the text content of an element, treating the input as plain text. This means that special characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, `&`) are treated as literal text and don't need to be escaped or converted into HTML entities. | **Write**: Sets visible text content of an element, escaping special characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, `&`). Instead, they're converted into their corresponding HTML entities (e.g., `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`) to ensure they're displayed as text and not interpreted as HTML markup. | **Write**: Sets HTML content inside an element, allowing dynamic modification of element structure and styling. This means it'll apply any HTML formatting it sees. For ex., `.innerHTML("<b>World</b>")` would be interpreted as actual HTML markup and render the string **World** in bold.  |
| **Performance**: The fastest as it's optimized for efficient manipulation of plain text content within elements. Ideal for scenarios with large text volumes or frequent updates. | **Performance**: Slightly slower than `.textContent` due to additional processing required when calculating visible text based on styling rules and ignoring hidden elements. Use when precise visual text representation is necessary. | **Performance**: Generally the slowest of the two due to the complexity involved in parsing and rendering HTML content. Frequent updates or extensive changes to `.innerHTML` may impact performance adversely due to the re-parsing and re-rendering of HTML content. |

*Noting that innerHTML is a known XSS vulnerability. This means that modifying .innerHTML directly with user-provided data can pose security risks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, if not properly sanitized or validated.
